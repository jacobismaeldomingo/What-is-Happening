What's Happening is an online site that allows community members to upload their events and contact
information so that users can view upcoming events and potentially contact event organizers to
purchase tickets, contribute etc.

It has the following functionality:
- Responsive pages with a landing page
- Collections of events organized by themes and dates
- The ability for community groups to upload events and for users to search for events
- Other administrative duties (e.g., upload event information, remove events after dates, and sign in).

The users of this site would include Community groups who can add events, general users who can view
the events, and administrators who ensure that the site is secure and up to date.
